        <h5>Inheritance</h5>
        <p class="imageCenter"><img src="img/shade.jpg" class="blogimage"></p>
        <p id="blogContent">
            I’m not talking about the concept of inheritance seen in many programming languages; nor am I bringing up a point from a genetic basis. This post I’m writing about is trying to stimulate a thought and understanding of the true tragedy of humanity. Often times, we’re brought into the line of thinking that we have full control over everything that happens in our lives. What we want to study for in college, whether we choose to help a certain person or not, or even the type of literature/movie/song are all things that we choose to like. Wrong. We didn’t choose anything; everything about who we are was inherited from the world – the environment from which we were exposed to.
        </p>

        <p id="blogContent">
            I just wanted to bring the point that most people don't necessarily 'choose' to be who they are. Inadvertently, our life experiences really influence how we see the world and what 'decisions' we choose when we come to a fork in a road of life. It always brings me to question how someone can bring so much hate to certain groups of people. And while there are stereotypic behaviors to some ethnic, religious, or various other ideological groups – I want to address the group that everyone seems to universally hate. The bad guys – the criminals, the murderers, the racists, the crazy – and so many other sub groups targeted to be evil. Now understand, I’m not condoning their actions or even defending them for the matter. I simply want to bring the understanding that these unfortunate people are byproducts of a cruel and unfair world. <b>No one inherently wants to be a bad guy.</b> It's not like someone who was abused or had a rough upbringing can just flip a switch and be a good person again. It’s one of those points that are really hard to fully comprehend until you’ve lived a lifetime – their lifetime – in their shoes.
        </p>

        <p id="blogContent">
            In a sense, it's a mental illness brought about by these unfortunate experiences. The same way you don't just pick up a knife and stab the person next is the same way that a person with a rough upbringing can't just spontaneously turn a good leaf. It’s really a hard concept to understand, and I admittedly suffer from the same judgement. Sociopaths and the like all view themselves as fully justified beings while the rest of the world is against them. In their eyes, the rest of the world is flawed, and they’re normal people. Now the question is: how did this kind of skewed mindset arise? Two problematic points are the origins of such, parents and the environment. Essentially, bringing back the heated debate of nature vs nurture, and the effect it has on our personalities. Now, I’ve already discussed how events we are exposed to in our daily lives subtlety affects us; the other point is parents.
        </p>

        <p id="blogContent">
            Now, I have nothing against parents. I’ve been blessed with two very able people to bring me into this world and guide me to the best of their ability throughout life. But they’re flawed human beings. Unfortunately that’s life and the fact that anyone could even imagine themselves as perfect is living in nothing but a life full of illusions. Although this is my opinion, I believe bringing a child into this world is purely motivated through selfish desires. (Continued Later...)

            It wasn't that long ago that I stood outside the doors of Kane Hall at 8am waiting to go into my CHEM 142 class. A lot has changed since then as well as a lot of things remaining the same. Although I could go on and on about all of the difficulties, fun, and mistakes that I have undergone since my time as a youthful freshman, I'm going to make one point. Heading to my first class of my first quarter at UW, nothing could have prepared me for what to expect going forward. Much of it is like life in this regard. We often have our lives planned straight from the beginning, but those aren't necessarily the most memorable parts that we retain later on in life. It's the unexpected occurrences that unhinge us from our perceived path to success and truly question our ability to adapt and growth.

            Life is like walking down a set of stairs in the dark and thinking that there is one more stair than there actually is. Your foot falls through the air downward and there is a surprising moment of dark desperation as you try and readjust your movement. The people that can correct themselves end up successful. Those that fall, don't. This is life.

            To add some context to this, this is basically one of the few protagonist in my story that is having a difficult time reconciling who he actually is and who he is meant to be in a world that doesn't necessarily favor his existence. Some cirumcstances that occur negatively affect his sanity, and he's really holding on to accomplish a given goal. This is all very vague, but I'm sure if the future allows it, the entire story will make sense later. Just know that everything is a struggle, just learn to accept that such things occur and never lose yourself to that part of you that you don't want to be.
