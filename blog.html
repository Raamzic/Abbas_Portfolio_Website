        <h5>My (Presumed) Last Year of University</h5>
        <p id="blogContent">
            It wasn't that long ago that I stood outside the doors of Kane Hall at 8am waiting to go into my CHEM 142 class. A lot has changed since then as well as a lot of things remaining the same. Although I could go on and on about all of the difficulties, fun, and mistakes that I have undergone since my time as a youthful freshman, I'm going to make one point. Heading to my first class of my first quarter at UW, nothing could have prepared me for what to expect going forward. Much of it is like life in this regard. We often have our lives planned straight from the beginning, but those aren't necessarily the most memorable parts that we retain later on in life. It's the unexpected occurrences that unhinge us from our perceived path to success and truly question our ability to adapt and growth.
        </p>

        <p id="blogContent">
            Life is like walking down a set of stairs in the dark and thinking that there is one more stair than there actually is. Your foot falls through the air downward and there is a surprising moment of dark desperation as you try and readjust your movement. The people that can correct themselves end up successful. Those that fall, don't. This is life.

            "How bliss would it be to lose myself to insanity like this?"
        </p>
        <p id="blogContent">

            To add some context to this, this is basically one of the few protagonist in my story that is having a difficult time reconciling who he actually is and who he is meant to be in a world that doesn't necessarily favor his existence. Some cirumcstances that occur negatively affect his sanity, and he's really holding on to accomplish a given goal. This is all very vague, but I'm sure if the future allows it, the entire story will make sense later. Just know that everything is a struggle, just learn to accept that such things occur and never lose yourself to that part of you that you don't want to be.

            "I'm merely a reader of a cruel, senseless book known as life. When I give advice, I'm merely peeking at the next few pages, so while I can try to give you some inspirational saying over and over again, you're the one that needs to rewrite the ending."

        <h5>From Quotes to Blogs</h5>
        <p id="blogContent">
            I'm going to be adding quotes from characters and their respective stories that I have created. Do note that all of these stories are unpublished and are merely the result of my imagination and willing to convey the realities of life in a digestable, metaphorical fashion. These can be oddly philoshopical, or they can simply be 'strong' moments in a story based context. To add some brevity to this, anything sounds profound if you throw quotes around it, hahahaha.

        <p id="blogContent">
            Welcome to my blog. Occasionally, I'll be posting content on things that I find interest, should be mentioned, or just random thoughts that are floating around in the dark crevices of my mind. Usually, most of these updates are reflections of what's been going through my head or merely observations of work, school, or everday life. Feel free to connect with me through social media or in person if you would like to talk more about anything on my blog. Stay tuned and connected!
